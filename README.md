# Data-Science-Jobs-2024-Linkedin-Canada
In this project, I will use "LinkedIn Canada: Data Science Jobs 2024" data set from kaggle.com 

to analyze the Data Science and Analysis job market in Canada as depicted in LinkedIn at the beginning of 2024.

I will mainly aim to:

. Identify trends in job availability across different provinces or cities in Canada.

. Analyze the distribution of job types and roles within the data science field.

. Compare qualifications and experience levels sought by employers.

. Investigate sector-specific demand for data science skills.
